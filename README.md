# Learning interpretable representations of material appearance

This repository contains the code used during the master thesis of Santiago Jim√©nez Navarro in the Master Program in Robotics, Graphics and Computer Vision. It builds on top of the original [Disentangled VAE](https://github.com/YannDubs/disentangling-vae#disentangled-vae--) and the [Disentanglement Lib](https://github.com/google-research/disentanglement_lib) repositories.

## Set up
1. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file. 
2. Download the necessary files:

 - The Serrano21 (LDR) [dataset](https://mig.mpi-inf.mpg.de/). Move the `color_chnl` folder to `data/serrano`, rename it to `color_chnl_original` and execute the script `change_shape.py`.
 - Background [masks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wfcutJ0ufLhvcA3wA3B8EcxuX2w9C9Dy?usp=sharing). Place them in `data/serrano/one_exr_per_geom`.

3. Modify the file `hyperparam.ini` to make sure that the paths are correct in your machine.

## Dataset
Now that we have the original Serrano21 dataset, we can build the subset that we want, for example, executing the `get_masked.py` script with the option 1 (the variable `mode` inside the script). This will generate a folder called `masked-serrano`, which should be the value of the `training_dataset` variable in the `hyperparam.ini` file.

## Train
Run the training command, specifying all the required parameters, for example:

    python main.py factor_serrano_test -d serrano -l factor --lr 0.0005 -b 128 -e 1000 -z 20 -f 500 --lr-disc 0.00001

After the training is complete, two new folders will be created with the results, whose path is defined in the `hyperparam.ini` file (by default named `results` and `runs`).

To check the development of the training, you can use Tensorboard. For example, by running `tensorboard --logdir "disentangling-vae-master/runs"` and then opening `http://localhost:6006/` in a browser, you should see plots similar to these:

## Test

Test the trained model, using the `main_viz.py` script. For example, to generate all the plots, run:

    python main_viz.py factor_serrano_test all -r 8 -c 7

This should give a result similar to this:
